Version 0.2 Released!
=====================

This version has working preview functionality.

Try it for yourself!


Tutorial: Present the Gitpress Blog locally
-------------------------------------------

First, make sure you have Gitpress installed:

```bash
$ pip install gitpress
```

Next, download the Gitpress Blog content:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:joeyespo/gitpress-blog.git
```

And finally, preview it locally:

```bash
$ cd gitpress-blog
$ gitpress preview
```

And that's it! Browse through the blog repository to get a better feel of its
simplicity. This is ideally how your own blog should be laid out as well.
Free of any presentation logic.

In upcoming versions, you'll also be able to use git to deploy your content
after previewing it locally. Theming is on the way as well.

This should all look pretty familiar to you. Chances are you have an
edit-preview-deploy routine in you already from developing!
