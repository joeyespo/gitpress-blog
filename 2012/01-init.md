Gitpress Init
=============

This is first official post of Gitpress!

This is a milestone, considering not a single line of code for Gitpress has
been written. The project is still early in the design phase. However, I'll
be eating my own dog food here. Consider this post a declaration.

If you're reading this on [gitpress-cms.com][site], then things must be going
well! The source of this post [has always been available on Github][post], long
before it was officially published. For the record, at the time of this
writing, I had no idea what Gitpress will look like by then. Well ok.
I do have an idea. But ideas get lost in implementation. Especially
when you listen to feedback which is exactly what I intend to do.
