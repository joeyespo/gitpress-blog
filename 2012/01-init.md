This is first official post of Gitpress!

This is a milestone, considering not one line of code for Gitpress has been
written. The project is still in the early design phase. However, Gitpress will
be eating its own dog food. Consider this post a declaration.

If you're reading this on [gitpress-cms.com](http://gitpress-cms.com), then
things must be going well. The source of this post [will be available
on Github](http://github.com/joeyespo/gitpress-blog/blob/master/2012/01-init.md)
long before it is officially published.
